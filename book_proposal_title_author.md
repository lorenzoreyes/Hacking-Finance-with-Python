### **Overview**

Describe your book. In this paragraph, tell us:

This book is a cookbook recipe, for a beginner in Python as well in Finance, it aims no pre requisites to read the book, but nonetheless the effort of
the reader to re make the examples, be aware of the context and then, only having following the previous steps, be able to modify them according to your
needs or desire. In particular, this book its focused on Argentina's Finance, mainly because all the literature related is suited for the US Economy, where 
theory and practice do not differ much, and in the case of Argentina we will handle all little details to have our own suited trading platform and gain awareness
of the whole process. Under this approach we aim to show the reader a python concept applied to a financial concept, tackling two problems at once, because
under my personal experience the best software we can make is the one that achieves a user need. As a result, the reader that has come through this process
will be one that not only has all the information needed to do tasks they face, but also will be a better user because has acknowledged of all little details 
and overcome them.

* Core technologies/topics => Python
* Audience and skills they should already have => Beginners in programming with almost none previous experiencie, or also the seniors developers that wants to learn finance
* applied to programming.
* Real-world problems you show readers how to solve => From being a noob of managing rates, fixed income, portfolios and futures to be professional financial analyst.
* How you approach the topic (building a test application, cookbook style recipes, short exercises, anecdotes from real-life stories, and so on)?
* CookBook recipe, where I will show a real-worl problem, describy its challenges and how to solve it step-by-step putting in the process the "typical code we all google
on how to do a particular thing until we hit a solution"
* What excites you about this particular topic (your motivation for writing the book)? I was a professor on this topic and also I learn as a self-taught programmer
The main scenario I see is that for the majority Python its too much to do daily tasks, and the effort does not worth it. In books I also see a common mistake
of not providing examples and explaining concepts too broad for the beginners, so I want to do something completely different.


### **Outline**

List the chapter titles and a sentence explaining what the chapter covers.

* 0 [Starter-Pack] Why Python/Finance/Argentina, (to whom is this book for) how to switch from a common user
to a programmer that delivers suited software for your personal use.

* 1 [Finance-Applied-Argentina] As a developer we have to study the market we are targeting, describe how it behaves and
what are our constraints. We will see how to manage rates, the value of time in finance, read corporates cash flow, bonds fixed income
and futures-&-options. (Illustration on how easy is to apply this concepts in Python).

* 2 [Real-Time-Processing] Gather information to do real time analysis.

* 3 [Create-a-Stock-Broker] Describe the process of scraping information, applied a proper optimization to it, create as a 
result a portfolio and monitor how it performs.

* 4 [Scalability] From previous example, convert your code from a specific case into a more broad one to handle more requests.

* 5 [Deliver Emails] Prepare communications with customers as now you have to handle thousands of requests asynchronously.

* 6 [Final thoughts] Opinion of a good programmer, paradigms, documentation and attitude.


### **Bio**

Lorenzo Reyes is a self made programmer, that started as a personal developer creating all his to-do-list of financial tasks replacing Microsoft Excel with Pyhton. 
He had the attribute to be an extreme minimalistic developer, with a deep love for functional programming style, looking to be the most lazy/productible possible.
He also had been a professor, incharge to motivating new generations into this field, destroying the image that a programmer cannot be a financial programmer or quant.
With programming he aims to acknowledge the student that they can get rid off all daily and tedious tasks and focusing on the important aspects.

### **PragProg books** 

List PragProg books that complement your book.

For each book, tell us:
* Title
* Author
* Year published
* How your book relates and how it differs
* If complementary, in what order should they read your book--before they read this one or after?
 

### **Market size**

### Writing sample

We would love to see an example of your writing. If you've written any other books, please link to them here and, if possible, send us a sample chapter from somewhere in the middle of your most recent book as a separate attachment. If you've never written a book but you have written online tutorials, blog posts, or anything else designed to teach people how to do something technical, please point us to where we can see those writing samples ourselves. And if you've never done any sort of public writing before, that's okay. We may ask you to send us a five-to-seven-page example draft from the book you'd like to publish with us after we've reviewed your proposal, but we'll provide more details on that when the time comes.
