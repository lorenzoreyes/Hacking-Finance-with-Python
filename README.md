> This is a book aimed to learn python by applying real finance, by being a financial analyst in Argentina Economy (dealing with lack of information,
handling data errors and making things work)

You will get your hands dirty, there will be no Fabozzi/Hull/Allen,Brealey&Meyers theory cases in this book, 
I mean this case is tough, argentinian tough level to be honest, and all known books are perfect, but theoretically perfect
When you have to deal with outside US and be an emerging country your working scenario is blurry, to say it nicely.

We will simulate the day-to-day of an argentinian handling the finance of a little store called "La Pulperia: Tienda de Ramos Generales, Despacho de Vida y Cancha de Bocha" (honor to Don Luis Landriscina) and all its constraints that faces daily.


## Chapters of the Book.

     Plot it. Once you have your data and it is clean you need a professional look to show it.

* 3. [Create a Stock Broker] At the end of the day brokers process informations, being the "professionals" a kind of API between customers requests and markets operations.
     Generate a tool to gather input, generate a portfolio, deploy it, monitor the perfomance and update it under request.

* 5. [Scalability] In programming this is the keyword to level up your craft.
     Add a Mantainer. Your data is not static, so you will have to generate tools in order to be updated and trigger alarms when you need to fix stuff.

* 6. [Deliver Emails] Once all is done handle your customers with emails at large a scale to be informed of the flow of requests and proper respond them.

* 7. [Final Thougths] What this book is not and how to keep up with this.
